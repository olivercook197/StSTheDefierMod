      "You meet your client in a dingy bar, with all sorts of ~unusual~ denizens filling the air with their #r~odour~ and #r~noise~ . Although not your preferred crowd, you certainly feel like you share more in common with them than those that live their lives in quiet comfort. In return for completing the bounty, a selection of #grewards are available to you.",
      "There is nothing here that interests you, you take the #ygold and pick up another bounty, whose target resides further up the Spire.",
      "Full of adrenaline from the fight, you get into a high-spirited talk with a #rmenacing Gremlin Nob. Flashing your new wealth, you order two bottles of whiskey and talk long into the night. The night passes in a blur, and you wake up feeling not quite yourself, but invigorated by the conversation, the empty bottle at your feet. Bleary-eyed you find a bounty posted on the board, and head further up the Spire, hoping you’ll see your new #gfriend soon.",
      "You slide onto the stool beside a cloaked patron nursing a murky drink. With a crooked smile, they begin to ramble about forgotten halls, ancient machines, and old mistakes. Before you can slip away, they press a small velvet pouch into your hand. Inside rests a lacquered circlet humming with quiet, crystalline energy. \n\n \n\n“A little clarity for a ~cluttered~ mind.” They whisper. “Use it well.”  \n\n \n\nInside you find an object #bcold to the touch, and another bounty. It points you further up this strange spire.",
